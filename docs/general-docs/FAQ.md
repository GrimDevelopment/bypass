# FAQ

Some frequently asked questions for the BIFM project

- 

## Can you add `<site>`? 

Yes, as long as the site falls within one or more of these categories:

- Adlinks (like [adf.ly](https://adf.ly), [exe.io](https://exe.io/), [linkvertise](https://linkvertise.com/))
- Link protectors (like [Daddy's Link Protector](https://lnk.snahp.eu/), [wpsafelink](https://demo-safelink.themeson.com/template1/?f7fbb8af), [thinfi](https://thinfi.com/))
- Link collection pages (like carrd, linktr.ee, msha.ke)
- General URL shorteners (like bit.ly, tinyurl.com, goo.gl (formerly), and t.co)

When in doubt, check to see if a similar site is [already supported](./SITES.md).

Also be sure to see if the URL isn't already supported by checking [one of the instances](./INSTANCE.md) and running the URL.

Be sure your issue/DM to a contributor also has the following:

- An example link (example: `https://boost.ink/c5bba`) 
- A destination link (the link you are supposed to get at the end result, like `https://git.gay/a/bifm`).

Also be sure to include any other relevant information, like **the origin of the link** to further check the page.

## `<site>` is broken, can you fix it?

Yes, but please check if the bypass is broken on *as many instances as you see fit*.

This can be a regional thing and not something actually wrong with BIFM.

If you have made sure, please send an issue with the following information:

- The broken link (example: `https://boost.ink/c5bba`) 
- Where the link is *supposed* to lead (example: `https://git.gay/a/bifm`).
- Where the link leads according to BIFM (example: `https://theannoyingsite.com/`)
- Any errors given to you, this can help espescially if you run the instance you're on by yourself.
