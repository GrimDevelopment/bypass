# How to Write Extractors

This is the very basics of how BIFM works.

Each bypass for a site is in the `extractors/` folder in the root of the BIFM folder. For example, `bc.vc`'s bypass is `extractors/bcvc.js`. 

This is called modularity, it makes it very easy to contribute to BIFM and makes BIFM in general more organized.

To really get started, you need to make a file in the `extractors/` folder. Name it to be consistent between the others. 

For example, if your module was going to be for a website called `link.com`, name your extractor `linkcom.js`.
