Bypasses link protectors server-side. Now with more sites and easier to develop for.

## why server-side?
Fetching the pages from the client requires sending some information about your device to the tracking server (HTTP headers, IP address). For obvious reasons, this is not a great solution. It defeats the purpose of bypassing tracking links. By using a server-side solution, information about your client are never sent to these tracking servers, unless you explicitly want to.
